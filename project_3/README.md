Urban Ministries is a non-profit organization that seeks to provide food, job opportunities, and other services to the homeless community of Durham and the surrounding area. Using the data provided by UM, I hope to provide meaningful insight into the services they provide have changed over time, as well as how their services are being utilized currently. Three variables in the dataset that I believe will be of great importance when analyzing the data are the "Date", "Food.Provided.for", and "Food" variables. All coding for this project will be done using Python and R and organized using Bash and associated peripherals, including Makefiles and Docker.
