  Urban Ministries is a non-profit organization that seeks to provide food, job opportunities, and other services to the homeless community of Durham and the surrounding area.
I believe that how long clients stay with UMD is a key measure of UMD's overall performance, as it is an overall reflection of the amount of time it takes for UMD to assist their
clients until said clients are self-sufficient. Besides demographic factors, I believe that what disabilities the clients have, if any, may also be associated with the length of
their stay. Specifically, I decided to look at the disabilities that had been defined by Housing and Urban DEvelopment (HUD), as these are ones that are broadly used and recognized.
I was also curious as to whether any demographic factors seemed to be related to what kinds of disabilities clients may have, and what factors, if any, were associated with clients
who had a disability when they started their stay at UMD, but no longer had one at the time of their exit. Using a logistic regression, I plan to identify potential factors
associated with this phenomenon, so that UMD may identify what areas are most likely to assist clients with treatable disabilities. Using these analyses, I hope for UMD to gain
a better understanding of how disabilities affect clients and subsequently improve their services to better aid them.
